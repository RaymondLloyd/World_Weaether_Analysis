# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview
We will be analyzing data for "PlanMyTrip". We will be collecting and presenting data for customers on the PlanMyTrip website so they can type in their travel criteria to find their preferred hotel worldwide.

## Execution
In our first images, we see a scatter plot used to determine the "Max Temperature", "Humidity", "Cloudiness", and "Wind Speed", and how it correlates to the "City Lattitude".

In these next images you can see the pinpoints on GoogleMaps that shows the desired weather criteria that the customer types in. The first shows the locations. The second shows locations and city weather information.

Here in these final images we made a "Travel Itinerary" that shows the destinations and path of the planned vacation. The second image shows the city location and weather information when pin points are selected.

## Summary
  Looking at the outputs of our code and images, we can determine that certain Lattitudes only fit the criteria of the temperature preferences. (High of 90 degrees and Low of 75 degrees) We can also see the amount of cities that fit the criteria and when the pinpoint is selected, will show you a small sample size of the weather at that location.
  
  The vacation itinerary allows us to plot out a route for our next vacation. It shows the locations as well as weather info of those cities. It also shows us the driving path to each city from the last city visited.
